            abstract: 'U.S. colleges and universities create knowledge—and promote American well-being—through their exercise of academic freedom and openness. Openness demands that American universities admit the world’s best students, many of whom are Chinese. Academic freedom requires that all scholars in the United States respect principles of free inquiry and critical discourse, regardless of their countries of origin. With China as the greatest source of foreign students to the U.S., and with China’s authoritarian government summoning students to serve a motherland engaged in worldwide competition with the U.S., prudence dictates a close look at the impact of Chinese students and the Chinese officials charged with managing them on American campuses.',

            abstract: 'Since 2004, the Chinese government has planted Confucius Institutes that offer Chinese language and culture courses at colleges and universities around the world—including more than 100 in the United States.These Institutes avoid Chinese political history and human rights abuses, portray Taiwan and Tibet as undisputed territories of China, and educate a generation of American students to know nothing more of China than the regime’s official history. This is a study of the 12 Confucius Institutes in New York and New Jersey. It examines China’s soft power influence through American higher education, and reveals new data on China’s funding, hiring, and academic freedom policies.',

Often traversing the revolutionary decades through the narrative of one individual or family, the films inject an intensely personal element to the time period, challenging the political movements and their harrowing consequences with tales that highlight the shared humanity of all involved.',
